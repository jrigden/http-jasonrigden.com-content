Talking Cryptocurrency Guest Guide
</h1>

Talking Cryptocurrency interviews the people making the cryptocurrency and blockchain revolution happen. We want our interviews to be engaging and informative for our listeners. This guide will help guests prepare for their upcoming interview.

If you have any questions about this guide, email jason@talkingcryptocurrency.net

If you have not already talked to us about an interview, please fill out the <a href="/guests/#form">guest form</a>. We will get back to you as soon as possible.

Make sure we have the appropriate contact information. If your assistant or marketing people should be the primary contact, please let us know.

Interviews for Talking Cryptocurrency are done over the internet. We use <a href="https://zencastr.com/">Zencastr</a> to record. Zencaster allows us to record our interview through the <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome web browser</a>. 

Interviews are scheduled through <a href="https://calendly.com">Calendly</a>. We'll send you a link that will allow you to schedule a good time for the interview. We'll be scheduling a full hour together. But, the interview will probably be less than 30 minutes long. 

Interviews are scheduled at least a week in advance. This is to allow the host to do research about the guest. We may have some pre-interview questions. If we do, we'll send you or your representative an email.  

Before the interview, email us information about any specific topics or promotions you'd like to talk about. Also email any head-shots or graphics that you would like us to use. 

You are going to need a computer with the <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome web browser</a> installed. Preferably, your computer will have a wired internet connection. It's best to have a real microphone or a headset. Your computer's built in microphone will make you sound less professional. 

The day before the interview, we'll send you a reminder and a link to the Zencastr session. 

Before the interview, make sure you will have a quiet space where you will not be interrupted. Silence your cell phone. Turn off notifications on your computer. Pause or quit DropBox and any other applications that use lots of bandwidth.

When it is time for the interview, follow the Zencastr link. We'll do a quick sound check. The host will confirm the pronunciation of the guests name and any important upcoming dates. We'll also do confirmation of the specific topics to be covered. 

Then we will start the interview.

If you have any questions at any time, please don't hesitate to ask. Email jason@talkingcryptocurrency.net
