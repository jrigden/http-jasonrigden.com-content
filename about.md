<p>
My name is Jason Rigden and this is my blog. On this site, I write programming tutorials, host a couple of podcasts, and sometimes post D&D stuff. This site is made with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. Pages are served with <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">Nginx</a> running on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_version_history#Ubuntu_16.04_LTS_(Xenial_Xerus)">Ubuntu 16.04</a>. <a href="https://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> is my VPS provider. 



<h2>Factiods</h2>

The following are semi-random factoids about me.

  </li>

</ul>



<h2>Projects</h2>

</li>
<li>

</li>

<p>
I've do programming tutorials on my YouTube channel called, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MrRigdensChannel">Mr. Rigden's Channel</a>. 
</p>

<p>
I've got a bunch of open source projects on <a href="https://github.com/jrigden">GitHub</a>.
</p>

<h2>And Now Something Personal</h2>
<p>
Neurodiversity is personally important to me. I think the best way to help, is to honestly talk about our own issues. I have a couple of issues that are noticeable, that I should briefly talk about. They say that vulnerability is endearing, so here it goes. 
</p>

<p>
If you have read any of my articles you have probably noticed spelling and grammatical errors. Sorry about that. It even comes out in my speech sometimes. I'm pretty sure I have some sort of dyslexia. Please know that I try my best to find and correct these errors. But, unfortunately they are often invisible to me. A good way to get on my bad side is to be disrespectful when making corrections.  Nobody likes a grammar nazi. 
</p>


<p>
I have lots of anxiety. It is often displayed as social anxiety. It often prevents me from engaging with my community as much as I would like. I try very hard be social. It's not that I don't like to socialize. I'm just sometimes not very comfortable with it. It can be very draining. Crowds of people suck the energy right out of me. I do try to be social but sometime I can be flaky and seem distant. Sorry about that. 
</p>
