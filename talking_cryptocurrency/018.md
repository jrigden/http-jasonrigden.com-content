Jason Rigden interviews Nakia J. White of <a href="https://houseafrica.io">HouseAfrica</a>. They are enhancing real estate in Africa using blockchain technology. They are making the buying, selling and rental process of properties less costly, more convenient and secure. Iâ€™m really excited about the blockchain projects in Africa. It was great talking to Nakia. You are going to love this interview! This is a great project with so much potential. I love these decentralized real estate platforms. This project could change so many lives.
