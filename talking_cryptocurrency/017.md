Jason Rigden interviews <a href="https://twitter.com/ameensol">Ameen Soleimani</a> of <a href="https://spankchain.com">Spankchain</a>. They are building a cryptocurrency powered adult entertainment ecosystem built on the Ethereum network. We all know that the adult entertainment industry has historically lead technological innovation. From VHS to the internet and now cryptocurrency. <a href="https://spankchain.com">Spankchain</a> could revolutionize billion-dollar industry. 

Spankchain is a very interesting project. It has so much potential to help adult entertainers operated with more freedom and efficiency. Human sexuality is a fundamental human right and it is under attack all the time. I so happy see projects like Spankchain fighting back with technology. If you want to learn more all the links are in the show notes.
