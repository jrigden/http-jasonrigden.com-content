They are helping you to import transactions, calculate gains and income, and file your tax returns on your cryptocurrency holdings. Thanks Pat for coming on the show. ZenLedger sounds like a great service for crypto traders and holders. None of this interview should be considered tax advice but the followings is: Pay your taxes.
