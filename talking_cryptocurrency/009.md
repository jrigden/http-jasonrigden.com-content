Hello, my friends and welcome to the Talking Cryptocurrency. I'm your host <a href="https://twitter.com/mr_rigden">Jason Rigden</a>. 
On this episode of the podcast, I'm talking to David Dubrulle Co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://cryptosouk.exchange">CryptoSouk</a>. They are building a cryptocurrency exchange for the middle east. I love local solutions to local problems. And these folks are going to really open up the region to crypto trading in a way that no one has seen yet. If you want more information about the company or its upcoming presale, the links are in the show notes. 

Do you know what the best form of advertising is? Word of mouth. It's been that way since the beginning of time and it will be that way till the end of time. We trust our friend and respect their opinions. When they tell us something is good we believe them. So, if you like this show would you please consider tell friend. You can tell them face to face or over the internet. Just help spread the show by telling someone else about it. If you like this show, there is a good chance you have a friend that will like it too. Why not share it with them? Thanks. 

Thanks, David for coming on the show. <a href="https://cryptosouk.exchange">CryptoSouk</a> is fixing the unmet need for a centralized cryptocurrency exchange in the Arabic language for the middle east. I'm sure there is a ton of pent up demand for this. I wish you a lot of luck. Sounds like you have a solid plan and the skills to make it happen. Links to the site and their <a href="https://cryptosouk.io/en/ico">upcoming pre sale</a> are in the show notes. 

You've been listening to the Talking Cryptocurrency Podcast. My name is Jason Rigden and I've been your host. Thanks for listen to the show. I look forward to talking to you again soon. Have a great day.
