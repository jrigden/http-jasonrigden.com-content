Jason Rigden talks to Kyle Lu of <a href="https://www.dapp.com">Dapp.com</a>. Dapp.com is a great place to discover and learn all about decentralized apps. I highly recommend the site and I recommend you listen to this interview. Thanks Kyle for coming on the show. I think Dapps are the future and you site is right there on the edge. You care empowering decentralized application users and developers.
