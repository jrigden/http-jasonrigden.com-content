Jason Rigden interviews Ganesh Swami of <a href="https://www.covalenthq.com">Covalent</a>. Covalent using data to cut the noise & bring transparency to the crypto market. This is a cool project and a great interview. Thanks Ganesh for coming on the show. Covalent is providing much needed information to its customers. There is so much noise out there. I see really value in their services.
