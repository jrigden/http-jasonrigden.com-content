Hello, my friends and welcome to The Talking Cryptocurrency Podcast. I'm your host <a href="https://twitter.com/mr_rigden">Jason Rigden</a>.
On this episode I am talking to Rashid Aziz of <a href="https://www.flareagent.com">FlareAgent</a>. FlareAgent is bringing  AI and the blockchain to real estate. If you have ever bought a house, you'll know that the process is a bit antiquated. Tons of people need to be involved there is paperwork everywhere. Its a big old mess. Luckily, FlareAgent is trying to bring that process into the 21st century. Before we jump into the interview, I have a quick message.
