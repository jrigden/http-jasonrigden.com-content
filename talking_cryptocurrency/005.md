Hello, my friends and welcome to The Talking Cryptocurrency Podcast. I'm your host Jason Rigden.
On this episode I am talking to J. Mohan of <a href="https://www.covex.io/">Covex</a>. They are building an all in one digital trading platform for cryptocurrency. It really is an all in one solution. This is a really ambitious project and I very thankful for their time. If you want to check them out, all the links are in the show notes. The interview will start right after this quick message.

I just want to let you know that I publish these episodes in a few different places. The first place of course is the podcast itself. But I also publish it on my blog at jasonrigden.com. And I turn them into videos that get published on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaznk2AsVEhlAl0u2fOLNsw">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://d.tube/#!/c/mr-rigden">DTube</a>. The links to those channels will be in the show notes. If you could, would you maybe subscribe to one or both of those video channels. Or if you are watching the video version maybe subscribe to the podcast in your favorite podcast player. That way you won't miss an episode. And it will make me very happy.


A big thanks to Mr. Mohan for coming on the show and introducing us to <a href="https://www.covex.io/">Covex</a>. Once again, they are building an all in one digital trading platform for cryptocurrency. Go check out their website to learn more. The links are in the show notes.
