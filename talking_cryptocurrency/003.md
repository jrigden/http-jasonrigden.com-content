Hello, my friends and welcome to The Talking Cryptocurrency Podcast. I'm your host Jason Rigden.
On this episode we are talking to Patrik Krasnic of <a href="https://konios.com/">Konios</a>. They are building a decentralized platform to exchange cash to crypto. They are having an ICO on July 1st, 2018. So that's just a couple of days from now. It was an interesting conversation. Their project really addresses some the real world problems of using cryptocurrency. But before we go to the interview, I've got a quick message.


I just want to let my listeners know that I don't request or accept any money from my guests. I don't take tokens or coins for interviews. And I don't participate in marketing bounty programs. When I have guest on, it is solely because I think my listeners will find them interesting or informative. You might be surprised but that is not how everyone operates. Some shows only have guests on because they have paid some kind of fee. Cash, coins, tokens, or whatever. It's a pay to play system. I will never do that. I think that it makes a poor-quality show. It basically just turns a podcast episode in to a boring infomercial.  That is not the kind of show I want to make. I want to make the show I want to listen too. So that is what I am doing. I hope you like it.


Thanks Patrick for telling us all about <a href="https://konios.com/">Konious</a>. It sounds like a great solution to some of the real world challenges of using cryptocurrency. And it was interesting to here a bit about Switzerlands attitude toward the crypto industry. Seems to me that the countries that dont embrace this revolution now, will be left behind. If you want to know more about Konious, I've all the important links in the show notes.
