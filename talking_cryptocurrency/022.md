On this episode of the show, Jason Rigden interviews Chris Boscolo of <a href="https://lifeid.io">lifeID</a>. They are building an open source blockchain based platform for self-sovereign identity. This was a great interview and it was fun talking to another project from the Pacific Northwest. Thanks Chris for coming on the show. Our identity and personal info are so important. It’s good to hear that there are projects like <a href="https://lifeid.io">lifeID</a> trying to protect and empower us. If you want to learn more about lifeID, check the show notes. I’ve got all the links there.
