On this episode we are talking to Dan de Sa co-founder of <a href="https://www.coinmirror.co/">CoinMirror</a>. They are making syndicated ICO investing easy. 

But first, let’s talk about getting you on this show. Are you doing something interesting with the blockchain or cryptocurrency?   If you are a developer, a blogger, or even another podcaster, I want to talk to you. If you are an investor or entrepreneur, I want to talk to you. This show will always need guests. I will always be looking for the people making the cryptocurrency and blockchain revolution happen. If that sounds like you go to <a href="https://jasonrigden.com/guests">jasonrigden.com/guests</a>.

On that page will be a little form. Tell me your name, your email address, and why you think you would be a good guest on the show. And I will get back to you as soon as possible. 

I would say that there will never be a better chance to get on this show, than right now. As this show grows it will inevitably get harder and harder to get on as a guest. It’s just a matter of supply and demand. 

So don’t hesitate. Be brave be bold and fill out that form and you too could be the next guest on Talking Cryptocurrency.

I gotta say that I am really excited about <a href="https://www.coinmirror.co/">CoinMirror</a>. They really get it. These folks are giving us a glimpse at the future of ICO investing. I'm absolutely not getting paid to say this. This is from my heart. After you listen to the interview go to their website and check them out.  These guys are the future. They are pioneering the way most ICO investing is going to be done someday.

Thank you Dan for coming on the show. Thanks for introducing us to CoinMirror. I think it is a great idea. The ICO dream is still alive and it is evolving. It think we will hear big things from Codemirror in the future. If you want to check them out and you should, the links are in the show notes.

Before we end the show, I am required by law to ask you to review the show on Apple Podcasts.
But seriously, those reviews do really help. When a guest is looking to come on the show, one of the first things they do is check the reviews and ratings of the show. Those reviews show that I have an active and engaged audience. So please give me a hand and review the show in Apple Podcast.
