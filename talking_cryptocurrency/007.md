Hello, my friends and welcome to The Talking Cryptocurrency Podcast. I'm your host <a href="https://twitter.com/mr_rigden">Jason Rigden</a>.
On this episode we are talking to the folks from the <a href="https://gincoin.io/">GIN Platform</a>. They are offering a turn-key solution for running master nodes. We cover it briefly in this interview but if you want to know more about master nodes, check the show notes. <a href="https://coinsutra.com/masternodes">I'll have some links that explain the concept in detail</a>.

Well jump into the interview after this quick message.
