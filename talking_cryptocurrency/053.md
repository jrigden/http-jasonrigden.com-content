Jason Rigden interviews George Borovec of <a href="https://niffler.co">Niffler.co</a>. Niffler is a simulated crypto exchange. That mean you can learn about crypto trading without risking your capital. It sounds like a really cool project. Thanks George for coming on the show. Niffler sounds awesome. Before jumping into the real crypto markets, maybe give Niffler a shot first. You will probably be surprised how much you will learn. And you wonâ€™t lose your shirt.
