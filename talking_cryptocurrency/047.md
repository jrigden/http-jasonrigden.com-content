Jason Rigden interviews Sebastian Müeller of <a href="https://enzypt.io">Enzypt</a>. Enzypt is a cool project from the folks at <a href="https://flexdapps.com">Flex Dapps</a>. It’s a web3-enabled website that lets you buy and sell files through Ethereum and IPFS. It’s a beautiful project and it was great talking to Sebastian. I hope you like this interview as much as I do. Thanks Sebastian for coming on the show. I love this idea. The concept is great. I’m sure we’ll see lots of cool stuff coming from Flex Dapps in the future. Keep an eye on them.
