Hello and welcome to Talking Cryptocurrency with Jason Rigden.
I'm Jason and this is my show. Thanks for for giving this podcast a listen. This is our first episode. Our trailer episode. This is the episode where I explain what the show is about. And try to convince you to subscribe.

So what is this podcast about? Well maybe you know of my other podcast, Explaining Cryptocurrency. In that show I do short episodes that explain one topic in cryptocurrency and the blockchain. It's just me, a mic, and a script.

Talking Cryptocurrency is a little different. It's an interview show.  These will be one on one interviews with the people making the cryptocurrency and blockchain revolution happen. 

I've have a wide spectrum of guest coming soon. We've daytraders, CEOs, developers, and futurists. I really want my to be as diverse as possible.

Variety is the spice of life they say.
