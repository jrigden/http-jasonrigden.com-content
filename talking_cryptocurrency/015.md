Hello, my friends and welcome to the Talking Cryptocurrency. I’m your host Jason Rigden. On this episode of the show, we are talking to Alex Buelau CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://www.coinschedule.com/ ">Coinschedule</a>.  Coinschedule is the leading global portal for ICOs. They have been listing ICOs since 2016. They were one of the first sites listing ICOs back then. And they have become the best resource for discovering new ICOs. Their site is clean, fast, and, well designed. I use it almost every single day so, it was a real treat to talk to them. But Before we get into the interview, I've got a quick message. 

I really hope you like this show. I put a lot of into it. If you do like it, would you please rate review for the show on Apple Podcasts. If you are a hard-core podcast listener, you're probably sick of hearing this. Every show begs for reviews. It's a little annoying, I know. But it does make a difference. Those reviews help people decide to subscribe. They help guests choose which shows to go on. Those ratings and reviews for the show are a direct way you can help this show grow. So, if you like this show and you want more, please help me. Take a some time and give the show a rating and a review Apple Podcasts or iTunes. Or whatever it is called now. 

Thank you, Alex for coming on the show. I love your site. Like I said, I use CoinSchedule every day. It's an essential recourse for folks interested in ICOs. So, if you haven’t already discovered them and you are looking for an ICO listing site, check out <a href="https://www.coinschedule.com/ ">Coinschedule.com</a>. You won't be disappointed. The links are in the show notes. It was also really interesting to hear about how the Trust Score works. These folks are great. I don't know what I would do without them. 

You’ve been listening to the Talking Cryptocurrency Podcast. My name is Jason Rigden and I’ve been your host. Thanks for listening to the show. If you liked it, please consider giving us a rating and a review. I look forward to talking to you again soon. Have a great day.
