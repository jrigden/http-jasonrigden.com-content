Jason interviews Federico Ast of Kleros. Kleros is trying to provide fast, secure and affordable arbitration for virtually everything. They are using some really interesting game theory and the blockchain to do this. Itâ€™s a really interesting idea and a great interview. Thanks Federico for coming on the show. Kleros could be a huge deal. Dispute resolution is a huge pain. It takes too much money and time.er.
