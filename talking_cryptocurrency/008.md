Hello, my friends and welcome to the Talking Cryptocurrency. I'm your host <a href="https://twitter.com/mr_rigden">Jason Rigden</a>. On this episode of the show, we will talk with Dakota Kaiser from <a href="https://www.earthcycle.io">EarthCycle</a>.  A cryptocurrency empowering a decentralized funding pool for positive change businesses. They are trying to save the world with some truly cutting-edge technology. They have an upcoming ICO on August 1st, 2018.  The links are all in the show notes. But before we jump into the interview, I've a quick message. 

I need your help. I am always looking for project to interview. But I want today, is for you to tell me who, you'd like to see me interview. Send me a tweet, with a mention of this show and who you want me to interview. The show's twitter handle is in the show notes. Just tweet me about who you want to be a guest on the show and why. I'll try to make it happen.  Now, I probably won't be able to get the bigwigs, so donâ€™t get your hopes up too much.  But if you have a favorite project, tell me about. Thanks. 

Thanks Dakota for coming on the show. EarthCycle is an inspired project. I wish you lots of luck.  Go to their website for more info about the project and the ICO. The links are in the show notes.
