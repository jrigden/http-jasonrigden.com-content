Hello, my friends and welcome to the Talking Cryptocurrency podcast. I’m your host Jason Rigden. On this episode of the show, we are talking to Nick Alesandro of <a href="https://akash.network/">Akash</a>. <a href="https://akash.network/">Akash</a> is building the next iteration of cloud computing. It's a decentralized protocol for provisioning, scaling and securing cloud workloads. They are taking unused server capacity and making it available for cloud deployments. As the host of this show, I'm not supposed to have favorites. But, I do. This has been my favorite project to talk about so far. I hope you like the interview as much I did. But before we get into the interview, I have a quick message. 

I really hope you like this show. I put a lot of into it. If you do like it, would you please rate review for the show on Apple Podcasts. If you are a hard-core podcast listener, you're probably sick of hearing this. Every show begs for reviews. It's a little annoying, I know. But it does make a difference. Those reviews help people decide to subscribe. They help guests choose which shows to go on. Those ratings and reviews for the show are a direct way you can help this show grow. So, if you like this show and you want more, please help me. Take a some time and give the show a rating and a review Apple Podcasts or iTunes. Or whatever it is called now. 

Thanks Nick for coming on the show. <a href="https://akash.network/">Akash</a> is really exciting. I get the same feeling about this as I did when I first heard about Amazon's EC2. That was a game changer and I think <a href="https://akash.network/">Akash</a> is too. I can’t wait to start experimenting with it. If you want more info about Akash, all the links are in the show notes. 

You’ve been listening to the Talking Cryptocurrency Podcast. My name is Jason Rigden and I’ve been your host. Thanks for listening to the show. If you liked it, please consider giving us a rating and a review. I look forward to talking to you again soon. Have a great day.
