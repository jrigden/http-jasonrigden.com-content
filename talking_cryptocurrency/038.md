Jason Rigden interviews Peter Harris founder and CEO of Resonate. Resonate is trying to change the way we stream music. Giving more power to listeners & musicians. And they are using blockchain technology to do it. This was a fun interview, I hope you like it. Thanks Peter for coming on the show. Resonate is a really cool project. Streaming music has totally changed how we listen to music. And Resonate might just revolutionize the way we stream music. It’s also another example of a blockchain project using the cooperative model.
