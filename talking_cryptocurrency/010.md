Hello, my friends and welcome to the Talking Cryptocurrency. I'm your host <a href="https://twitter.com/mr_rigden">Jason Rigden</a>. On this episode of the show, we are talking to Navjit Dhaliwal CEO of <a href="https://www.iagon.com">IAGON</a>. They are building decentralized cloud services. Essentially, they want a giant global supercomputer powered by the blockchain. This is a really fun project. I love decentralized apps and computing. This stuff is the next generation of the cloud. Before we get to the interview, I've of course got a quick message. 


Do you want to hear something sad? Well, your gonna hear it anyway. I have a sad confession. The Talking Cryptocurrency podcast has not had a single review on Apple Podcasts yet. It's tragic and it breaks my heart. Luckily, you can do something about it. Yes, you can make my little heart swell with just one review on Apple Podcasts. It doesn't even have to like the show. I'll take anything.  So, how about if you become the first the write a review. Do it today. Or tomorrow. Just as long as the show get a review. Thanks. 


Thanks, Navjit for coming on the show. <a href="https://www.iagon.com">IAGON</a> could be game changer. I really think that we are on the verge a revolution in cloud computing and these folks could be the ones that make it happen. They have an ICO sale going on now. The links to are in the show notes. You've been listening to the Talking Cryptocurrency Podcast. My name is Jason Rigden and I've been your host. Thanks for listen to the show. I look forward to talking to you again soon. Have a great day.
