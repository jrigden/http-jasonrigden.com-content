Jason Rigden talks to Joshy Orndorff of RChain. RChain is a cooperative that is trying to solve some of the most important issues facing the blockchain. We are really lucky to have had Joshy come on and talk about RChain. This is a great interview about a really interesting project. You are going to love this episode. Thanks Joshy for coming on the show. RChain is a fascinating project. I think being a cooperative will give them a distinct advantage going forward. I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if we see alot more projects going in this direction. Their tech is really unique too. I strongly suggest checking the show notes to learning more about RChain and the community forming around them.
