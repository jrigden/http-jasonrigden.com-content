I made a new site yesterday, <a href="https://crypto.podcastlist.net/">The Cryptocurrency Podcast List</a>. This is a list of all the podcasts about cryptocurrency and the blockchain. It is not a curated list of my favorite shows. This is a list of every active crypto podcast. I made this site because the iTune "search" function is absolutely awful. It's kind of like using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltaVista">AltaVista</a> in the 1990's. Calling it useless is being too nice. Finding niche content has become almost impossible because of <a href="https://bigpodcast.com/2018/04/08/the-double-edged-sword-of-podcast-keyword-stuffing/">keyword stuffing</a>. So, I made this <a href="https://crypto.podcastlist.net/">list</a>.
