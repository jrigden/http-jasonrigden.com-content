In the beginning there was  **wardailing**. This is when you use a machine to scan phone numbers looking for other machines. Those machines might be phone exchanges, modems, fax machines, etc. The structure of phone numbers made it easy to target geographically. In the USA, you could figure out the region from the area code and often the city with the prefix. Now days cell phones and oddly shaped area code maps make this a bit tougher.

Later there was  **wardriving**. This is when you search for wifi signals from a car. You would drive around an area recording wifi signals and their locations. Traditional wardriving required a bit of equipment. Usually, you would have a laptop, some antennas, a GPS, and a car.

**Warwalking**  is just  **wardriving**  but on foot. Usually, just using an android device. I suggest using the  [WiGLE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.wigle.wigleandroid)  app. It is free and open source. You can upload your data to WiGLE servers and download them from your device.

The  [Wireless Geographic Logging Engine (WiGLE)](https://wigle.net/)  is a service that aggregates the wardriving data from many users. They have cool site with nice maps and an api.

#### Wardriving vs Warwalking

In my testing the density of signal discovery is much higher walking than driving. But of course you can cover more distance driving. So I would say that warwalking is better in the city. If you are in the suburbs or the country, driving is still the best.

#### Warwalking Experince

I have been warwalking in Seattle for the last few days. I have walked about 15 miles and have seen about 40,000 wifi spots.

**Downtown Seattle**  was disappointing. I expected Downtown to have the highest density wifi signals in the area. Unfortunately, I did not observe this. Also the tall building and awnings interfered with my GPS.

**First Hill** and  **Capitol Hill**  have been rich in wifi signals. Especially multifamily residential building. Seems like multistory wood building are the best.

#### To Do

I hope to gather more data and do some crunching. Maybe I am crazy but I think I will shoot for 100K. I would like to get some numbers of popular wifi names, router makes, and encryption systems used.
