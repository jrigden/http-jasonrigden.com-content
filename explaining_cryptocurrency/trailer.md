<p>
Welcome to the Explaining Cryptocurrency podcast. I’m Jason Rigden and I’ll be your host. 
</p>

<p>
This isn’t going to be another hour long cryptocurrency podcast where I interview some boring startup founder. I’m not gonna be talking about investing or trading crypto. And I’m not gonna be pushing any alt-coin pump and dumps.
</p>

<p>
There are plenty of other people making those show.
</p>

<p>
This show is going to be about teaching you how and why cryptocurrency and the blockchain work. I’m going to introduce a different concept in every episode. We are going to be exploring things like the byzantine generals problem, zk snarks, and public key encryption.
</p>

<p>
I’m gonna to try to do this as simply as possible. I really want for this show to be understandable for the general public.
</p>

<p>
The cryptocurrency revolution is going to affect everyone. And I really want to create a resource for non-technical people. Although techy people are welcome too. Hopefully, everyone listening will learn something.
</p>

<p>
So, if you want to learn more about cryptocurrency, then this might be the show is for you.
</p>

<p>
The episodes will be short and to the point. Probably less 15 minutes each. I am going to shoot for a twice weekly show.
</p>

<p>
There’s not gonna be any advertisements on this show. And I’m not gonna ask for Patreon donations. This is a labor of love. I really believe in the power of cryptocurrency and the blockchain. And I think it is going to change everything.
</p>

<p>
I’m just looking for some small way to contribute. And educating people is the path I have chosen.
</p>

<p>
So I hope you’ll enjoy the upcoming episodes. And that they help you to understand this complex topic just a little bit better.
</p>

<p>

Once again, this has been the Explaining Cryptocurrency podcast and I am Jason Rigden.
</p>

<p>
I hope to talk to you again soon. Goodbye.
